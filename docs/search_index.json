Qiang Zhao, Wangzhi Li, and Weixi Yao 2019-12-12 Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Project Objective The goal of this project is to identify useful advice to stay away from collisions. 1.2 Background According to the Washington Post, there are about 1.7 million rear-end collisions on U.S. roads each year, and about 17,000 people die in those collisions and another 500,000 are hurt. Although high-tech car manufacturers such as Volvo, BMW and Tesla are spending a huge amount of effort building collision avoidance systems, such as the emergency braking system, standard equipment in their vehicles, we believe there are simple things we can do from day to day to help us stay safer, either as drivers or as pedestrians. 1.3 Project Outline In this project, we will draw and visualize the correlation between the number of collisions, the severity of collisions, and features such as seasonality, regionality, and human factors. From the correlation drawn, we then formulate the following three advice that people can easily follow and fundamentally helpful in avoiding collisions: During summer time, don’t follow too closely. During rush hours, especially on your way home, stay vigilant while driving. At this point, no external factor has been found that has a strong correlation with collision caused by distraction. So don’t blame bad weather. "],
["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes 2.2 Temperature Data: 2.3 Precipitation Data:", " Chapter 2 Data sources We use the follwoing data sources. 2.1 Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes The Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes is collected from the NYC OpenData website. The data contains all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC since July 2012. Each row represents a crash event with 29 columns that describe the crash, including date, time, location, vehicle type, number of people injured, number of people killed, and contributing factors. For this project, we would only consider 2013 and 2018 data as we want to analyze the collision data that has a complete year cycle. data url: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95 2.2 Temperature Data: The website shows the average monthly and annual temperautre (F/Fahrenheit) at Central Park. We pick out the value in 2017-18 and save them in a new cvs file, which each row contains date and temperature value.Based on this data, we plan to find a correlation between temperature and number of collision by month. Although data only contains the temperature value at Central Park, it is representive, since the New York City temperature does not vary by a lot. data url: https://www.weather.gov/media/okx/Climate/CentralPark/monthlyannualtemp.pdf 2.3 Precipitation Data: The website is a weather data base and have historic weather data since 1942. We collect weather data at JFK and are only interested in the daily precipitation value between 2013-2018. Later, we try to find a correlation between precipitation and collision of specific reason.

["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Dataset combining: 3.2 Sanity check on location data: 3.3 Dataframe subsetting", " Chapter 3 Data transformation We mainly focus on the following aspects of transforming the raw data into forms that we could work with in R: 3.1 Dataset combining: Making pivot tables provides a solution to work with datasets of different granularity. For example, when working with daily collision data with monthly weather data, we first use group_by() to group the daily collision data into monthly data and then combine grouped collision data with weather data for further analysis and visualization. 3.2 Sanity check on location data: Due to potential technical failures, some location data, recorded in longitude and latitude, locate outside of New York City and get removed from the dataset. Feature engineering Due to potential recording failures, some features contain obviously duplicate factors. For example, the “vehicle type” feature erroneously splits the factor “taxi” into two separate factors “Taxi” and “TAXI” and we manually combine these two factors into one single factor, for the purpose of analysis. 3.3 Dataframe subsetting While performing some analysis work, we tend to work with small subsets instead of the entire dataset, in order to be clean and fast.

["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Motor_Vehicle_Collisions - Crashes", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Motor_Vehicle_Collisions - Crashes 4.1.1 Column pattern Two types of variables have a noticeably large number of missing values: 4.1.1.1 Location-based variables Within all the location-based variables, they can be classified into three groups according to their missing values. Off-street and cross-street are the group that have the highest number of missing values. Since there are too many missing values for these two variables, we will not consider using them in our analysis. Then it follows that zip code and borough are the group that has second highest missing values. The latitude, longitude, and location are the group that has third highest number of missing values. Since location is essential to analyze the collisions, and the latitude, longitude, and location have the fewest missing values, we will use them as our location indicator. Although, comparing to latitude and longitude, zip code and borough are usually easier to access, these two variables have a noticeably higher number of missing values than latitude and longitude. One possible explanation of this pattern is that longitude and latitude information is usually automatically tracked by machines while zip code and borough require manual key-in. To tackle this issue and to make our results carry more value, we decide to plot map plots using longitude and latitude, instead of using borough and zip code. A further impact of our analysis will be discussed later. 4.1.1.2 Event-recording variables It is interesting to see all event-recording variables share the same level of missing variables. Especially for contributing factor vehicles, the number of missing values increases as the # of contributing factor vehicles increases. This pattern makes sense because it becomes rarer and rarer as the number of vehicles involved in a single collision incident increases. 4.1.2 Row pattern Among those two types of variables that contain a high volume of missing values, there is a uniform row pattern that, if one of the variables under a specific type ever goes missing, the rest of the variables under the same type usually miss together: 4.1.2.1 Location-based variables According to the missing value pattern plot, zip code, borough, longitude, and latitude, if ever go missing, usually miss together. Furthermore, variables such as latitude, longitude, and location are obvious triplets, meaning that, if one of them is missing, the other two are almost 100% missing. Patterns like that also reflect on the relationship between variables such as borough and zip code. The first pattern makes sense because these variables are representations of one single item from various aspects. Therefore, when one of those variables goes missing, it is almost 100% predictable that the other goes missing, for possibly the same reasons. The second pattern makes sense as well because variables belonging to the “twins” and “triplets” usually share the same geographical granularity. For example, the geographical granularity level shared by latitude and longitude is different from the geographical granularity level shared by zip code, borough and street name. 4.1.2.2 Event-recording variables According to the missing value pattern plot, contributing factor vehicle and vehicle type code, if ever goes missing, usually miss together. Also, starting from contributing factor vehicle 2 and vehicle type code 2, the number of rows that misses contributing factor vehicles and vehicle type codes increases dramatically. The first pattern makes sense because these two variables are just representations of one single item in two different aspects. Therefore, when one of those two variables goes missing, it is almost 100% predictable that the other goes missing, for possibly the same reasons. The second pattern makes sense as well because it is very rare for a single collision incident to have numerous contributing factors. To tackle these missing value patterns as well as to make our analysis less distracted, we mainly focus on the contributing factor vehicle 1 and vehicle type code 1 in our analysis as the “main” contributing factors. ``` "],
["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Geographical Insights 5.2 Number of Collisions per Day 5.3 Number of Collisions per Month 5.4 Number of Collisions per Month by Year 5.5 Bar Chart of contribution factor 5.6 Correlation analysis 5.7 Rush Hour 5.8 Precipitation", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Geographical Insights We will first show couple hexagon heatmaps of New York City Collisions between 2013/01/01 to 2018/12/31. Note we choose this time frame because we want to capture the entire year data to avoid possible seasonal impact. 5.1.1 Number of Collisions We can see that from the below hexagon heatmap, the majority of the collisions happened at Midtown region. This is expected as Midtown area tend to have the highest traffic volume. Then we want to see whether the above pattern remains if we take in the account of seasonal factor. In other words, does Midtown always has the highest number of collisions throughout the year? Thus, we assign season value for each collision based on its date and replot the hexagon heatmap facet by season (Winter: December to February, Spring: March to May, Summer: June to August, Fall: September to November). Yet, as we can see from below result, the pattern is the same among all the seasons, which Midtown has the highest collision count. However, we can observe that Summer has the overall highest collision count among all seasons. 5.1.2 Number of Deaths and Injuries Now Let’s look at the hexagon heatmap over the number of deaths from collisions. We can see that there is no clear cluster of death in geographical basis. Let’s also look at the hexagon heatmap over the number of injuries from collisions. We can see that there are three major clusters that have high number of injuries. The clusters are around at Midtown, West Bronx, and Crown Heights. 5.1.3 Vehicle Type From below chart, we can see that passenger vehicle has the highest collisions count follow by sport utility/station wagon then sedan. However, as we look at the death ratio and injured ratio, bicycle and motorcycle have the highest ratio. This result tells us that when a collision happens that the bicyclist and motorcyclist have a higher chance of death and injury. Thus, a bicyclist and motorcyclist should really pay attention when riding to avoid collisions. 5.2 Number of Collisions per Day We start by having a quick look at the number of daily collisions in NYC every year from 2013 to 2018. From the time series plot above, we initially conclude that although the number of daily collisions consistently fluctuates, the average number of daily collisions is visually consistent, while gradually increasing year by year. 5.3 Number of Collisions per Month To further decode the underlying pattern of collisions in NYC, we down-sampled the dataset by grouping daily data into monthly data. The graph prematurely confirms our initial conclusions from the previous plot by showing a consistent growth of collisions each year, while maintaining the seasonal pattern, such as peaks during the summers and drops during the winters. The pattern is so uniform that we have decided to take one more step to have a clearer year-by-year comparison. 5.4 Number of Collisions per Month by Year The resulted graph further confirms our hypothesis that although the number of collisions consistently increases every year, the uniform seasonal pattern behind the number of collisions in NYC not only gets preserved but also gets strengthened year by year, proving that there is a correlation between seasons and number of collisions. 5.5 Bar Chart of contribution factor To provide useful advice for people to stay safer during summer times, we start tackling the high volume of summer collisions by examining the top 15 contribution factors first. According to the horizontal bar chart above, driver inattention/distraction is the dominant number 1 contribution factor of collisions. This result prematurely echoes with the complexity and NYC traffic system, where one second of distraction or inattention could cause severe consequences. To further decode the potential relationship between contribution factors and seasonality, we create the above time series, where each line represents the percentage of change during different times of the year. According to the results above, we can see that, although distraction and inattention are the number 1 contributing factor for collisions in general, the number of collisions caused by following too closely significantly increases during summer times, while the others stay approximately the same. Although one could argue that the causes of a large number of summer collisions are complicated and cannot simply be answered by “seasonality”, as of now, the best conclusion we can draw from this dataset is that, given a large number of summer collisions, a good way to stay safer is to NOT follow too closely. 5.6 Correlation analysis According to online research results, the causes of a large number of summer collisions could be divided into 1. More kids are out of school; 2. High heat leads to higher equipment failure rate; 3. There tends to be more roadway construction in the summer. Although we can’t possibly make definitive conclusions regarding these three points from our dataset, we use the following correlation analysis to draw some initial findings on the correlation of heat, a unique feature of NYC summers, and collisions caused by various contributing factors. According to the results, high heat is strongly positively correlated to the number of collisions caused by distraction, following too closely and backing unsafely. Although premature, these findings could still shed new light on ways to stay safer from collisions during the summertime. correlation analysis 5.7 Rush Hour At this step, we have identified the correlation between seasonality and contribution factors of collisions. Conclusions drawn from previous analysis make us wonder whether there are times in a day, such as rush hours, that are more prone to collisions than the others. In the line plot above, we construct a direct year-on-year comparison showing the number of collisions by different time of a day. The results show strikingly uniform patterns, such that, regardless of what year, number of collisions uniformly spike during rush hours (8am and 5pm). In order to derive more actionable insights, we started by looking at proportion of collisions caused by distraction, by different time of the year. And we notice that these two plots are almost identical in trends, both spiking during rush hours and fading after leaving for work. More importantly, after a long day of work, people tend to be more prone to be distracted on their way home and on their way to work. Therefore, we conclude that, during rush hours, there tends to be more collisions, possibly due to higher traffic volume, and, more importantly, during rush hours, people are more likely to get distracted while driving. To sum up, we strongly recommend drivers to stay more vigilant during rush hours, especially on their way home. 5.8 Precipitation At this point, we have drawn more conclusions regarding the correlation between number of collision, and distraction, by bringing more variables into the equation. However, we haven’t discussed what exactly causes distraction, the number 1 contributing factor for NYC collisions? Are tired people simply more likely to be distracted, or is there an external factor making drivers more likely to be distracted. However, due to the limited data source, we could only try to answer this question by analyzing how whether, especially rain, could increase the possibility of getting distracted. Unfortunately, according to the correlation matrix above, we don’t identify any significant correlation between precipitation and number of collisions, and between precipitation and number of collisions caused by distraction. Therefore, a wiser advice at this point is that people shouldn’t blame rain for distraction, and it is the drivers themselves that are causing those collisions. "],

["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Limitation of this analysis: 7.2 Future directions: 7.3 Lesson learned:", " Chapter 7 Conclusion In summary, we believe that people can better stay away from collisions in NYC by following the three advice below: During summer time, don’t follow too closely. During rush hours, especially on your way home, stay vigilant while driving. At this point, no external factor has been found that has a strong correlation with collision caused by distraction. So don’t blame bad weather. 7.1 Limitation of this analysis: Due to high volume of missing location variable, especially borough and zip code, we are restrained from doing cross-borough analysis. Instead, we could only use map plots to give general insights of the data. However, while map plots can do a better job identifying spatial clusters, it carries less values in cross variables analysis. Second, since traffic is a very complicated topic, without further support from more reliable and granular data sources, some of the conclusions are valid only under the context of the datasets we use. For example, when we say precipitation is not a contributing factor to distraction, we don’t know what is a contributing factor to distraction, until further data comes in. 7.2 Future directions: First, we could utilize paid serviced such as Google Map API to recover the missing location variables, making the entire analysis more exhaustive. Second, we could combine our analysis with more diverse data sources, trying to disclose more potential influencers of traffic collisions in NYC. Third, we could make this type of analysis a regular task onwards. Because more data usually means more space for more advanced conclusions. 7.3 Lesson learned: First, pre-project brainstorming is crucial for the success of the project. Second, it is more efficient to keep all the data preparation in one place. Third, a reasonable split of tasks between the teammates usually lead to more efficient work flow and better results. "]
