# Conclusion

In summary, we believe that people can better stay away from collisions in NYC by following the three advice below:

1. During summer time, don’t follow too closely.
2. During rush hours, especially on your way home, stay vigilant while driving.
3. At this point, no external factor has been found that has a strong correlation with collision caused by distraction. So don’t blame bad weather.

## Limitation of this analysis:

Due to high volume of missing location variable, especially borough and zip code, we are restrained from doing cross-borough analysis. Instead, we could only use map plots to give general insights of the data. However, while map plots can do a better job identifying spatial clusters, it carries less values in cross variables analysis.

Second, since traffic is a very complicated topic, without further support from more reliable and granular data sources, some of the conclusions are valid only under the context of the datasets we use. For example, when we say precipitation is not a contributing factor to distraction, we don’t know what is a contributing factor to distraction, until further data comes in.

## Future directions:

First, we could utilize paid serviced such as Google Map API to recover the missing location variables, making the entire analysis more exhaustive. Second, we could combine our analysis with more diverse data sources, trying to disclose more potential influencers of traffic collisions in NYC. Third, we could make this type of analysis a regular task onwards. Because more data usually means more space for more advanced conclusions. 

## Lesson learned:

First, pre-project brainstorming is crucial for the success of the project.
Second, it is more efficient to keep all the data preparation in one place.
Third, a reasonable split of tasks between the teammates usually lead to more efficient work flow and better results.
