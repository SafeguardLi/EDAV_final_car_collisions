# Introduction

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to identify useful advice to stay away from collisions.

## Background

According to the Washington Post, there are about 1.7 million rear-end collisions on U.S. roads each year, and about 17,000 people die in those collisions and another 500,000 are hurt. Although high-tech car manufacturers such as Volvo, BMW and Tesla are spending a huge amount of effort building collision avoidance systems, such as the emergency braking system, standard equipment in their vehicles, we believe there are simple things we can do from day to day to help us stay safer, either as drivers or as pedestrians.

## Project Outline

In this project, we will draw and visualize the correlation between the number of collisions, the severity of collisions, and features such as seasonality, regionality, and human factors. From the correlation drawn, we then formulate the following three advice that people can easily follow and fundamentally helpful in avoiding collisions:

    a. XXXX
    b. XXXX
    c. XXXX
